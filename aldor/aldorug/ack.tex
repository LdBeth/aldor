\asharp{} was originally developed at IBM Yorktown Heights,
in various versions from 1985 to 1994, as an extension language 
for the AXIOM computer algebra system.
\asharp{} was further refined and extended at 
the Numerical Algorithms Group at Oxford,
before the formation of Aldor.org in 2002.

The principal designer of the language was Stephen Watt, 
now Professor of Computer Science at the University of Western Ontario.

out of the laboratory and into the real world.
