--------------
Need to decide how to implement foam units


class XX {
      // struct per format
      
      // Each function mappped to a static method

      // Formats implemented as Object[] 
      
}

=================


Gotos:

1: extract flow graph
2: Find blocks though which control must pass (ignoring returns)
