This library has been specially designed so that libfoam/runtime.as can
be compiled in an environment that won't be subject to changes in
Axllib/Basiclib etc. Please be very careful about changing anything
here, especially when changing the implementation of domains such as
PrimitiveArray. The Aldor runtime system (runtime.as) relies on being
able to inline every domain that it uses (with the exception of rtexns).

Recent changes to libaxllib domains were causing problems with the
optimisation of runtime.as. Coupled with the fact that we are moving
towards replacing Axllib with Basiclib, there is a need for a stable and
independent library for runtime.as.

In reality this library has been constructed by taking a stable version
of libaxllib and removing domains and categories that are not used by
the runtime system. Over time more domains can be removed but we have to
stop somewhere.

Note that this library is only used to provide something that runtime.as
will compile against. It does not need to be distributed with the final
system unless the libraries that will be used are missing the rtexns
stuff. Since Axllib and Basiclib both have these features the compiler
can link against those libraries rather than this one (which is
preferable).

Avoid using defaults if possible: the compiler currently inlines them
when it ought not to. However, without inlining of defaults we suffer
a huge performance loss.
