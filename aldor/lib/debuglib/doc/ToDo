-- Three technical difficuties: 
   1). When the debugger invokes the interrpeter to query variables,
       the initialization of functional closures with FOAM code has problem
       if the closure is in some functions rather than in last lexical 
       environment (top level). 
   2). Code generation module(genfoam.c) has bugs in generating FOAM codes w debugger.
       An Aldor source file should has the same FOAM code except the debugger hooks
       between FOAM version -wo debugger and FOAM version -w debugger. I suspect it is the
       reason we failed to create the algebra library with debugger version.
   3). To generate FOAM code of query commands more efficiently. Currently it is generated by 
       inserting into source file and compile the whole file to get the FOAM code. 

-- The debuglib has bug when steping between main file and library file. The debugger state
   or the interpreter state do not keep track of the file name properly. Thus the 
   Aldor-Emacs-Debug-Mode can highlight the line properly.   

-- Unimplemented functionalities:
   a). Conditinal breakpoint
   b). Toggle up and down stack frames, query specific frame variables.
   c). Try to display type info for querying variables. It is related to item 3) above.
