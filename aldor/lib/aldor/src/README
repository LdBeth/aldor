README for libaldor source tree (libaldor/src)
----------------------------------------------

This is the full source tree of the libaldor library. You can use it to
build libaldor from the sources (rather than from the distributed portable
object libraries) as well as to extract the documentation and test files.
Type '[g]make' for more infos on the various targets available.

NOTE: Where you see '[g]make', use 'gmake' on DEC/OSF1, 'make' on linux

1) To build the portable object libraries:
- set your ALDORLIBROOT environment variable to the main libaldor directory,
  your LIBPATH to $ALDORLIBROOT/lib and INCPATH to $ALDORLIBROOT/include

- go to the src directory and issue:
     [g]make release       to make libaldor.al
     [g]make debug         to make libaldord.al
     [g]make extract       to make the 'extract' executable
     [g]make aldoc2html    to make the 'aldoc2html' executable

- go to the lib directory and issue
     ln -s ../src/aldor_gloop.as
     ln -s ../src/aldor_gloop.as aldor_gloopd.as
     aldor -q5 aldor_gloop.as
     aldor -q1 -dDEBUG aldor_gloopd.as
  to make aldor_gloop.ao and aldor_gloopd.ao
  Note that aldor_gloop.ao and aldor_gloopd.ao are *NOT* part of libaldor and
  should not be stored in the library archive.


2) To build the object libraries, go to the lib directory and issue
   source makealdor-csh   or  source makealdor-bash   to make libaldor.a
   source makealdord-csh  or  source makealdord-bash  to make libaldord.a


3) To build the test-suite:
- make sure that the executable 'extract' is built and in your path
- go to the src directory and issue:  [g]make test
- go to the test directory and issue: make
