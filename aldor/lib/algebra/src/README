This is the full source tree of the Algebra library. You can use it to
build libalgebra from the sources (rather than from the distributed portable
object libraries) as well as to extract the documentation and test files.
Type '[g]make' for more infos on the various targets available.

NOTE: Where you see '[g]make', use 'gmake' on DEC/OSF1, 'make' on linux


1) To build the portable object libraries:
- set your ALGEBRAROOT environment variable to the main Algebra directory,
  your LIBPATH variable to $ALDORLIBROOT/lib:$ALGEBRAROOT/lib
  and INCPATH to $ALDORLIBROOT/include:$ALGEBRAROOT/include

- go to the src directory and issue:
   [g]make gmp        to make libalgebra-gmp.al
   [g]make release    to make libalgebra.al
   [g]make debug      to make libalgebrad.al


2) To build the object libraries, go to the lib directory and issue:
   'sh makealgebra-gmp' to make libalgebra-gmp.a
   'sh makealgebra'     to make libalgebra.a
   'sh makealgebrad'    to make libalgebrad.a


3) To build the test-suite:
- make sure that the executable 'extract' is built and in your path
- go to the src directory and issue '[g]make test'
- go to the test directory and issue 'make'
