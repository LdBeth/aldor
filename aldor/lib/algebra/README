README for the algebra library
------------------------------

This is version 1.0.3 of libalgebra.

You need Aldor 1.0.3 with libaldor 1.0.3 installed in order to
use this version of algebra library. Aldor and libaldor can be 
downloaded from http://www.aldor.org.

INSTALLATION:
-------------
o What the `algebra' sources for developers look like

[moreno@iguanodon algebra]$ ls
bin        doc      lib       Makefile.generic  src
COPYRIGHT  include  Makefile  README            test

o Variables that need to be set 
  - before building the libraries from the sources: ALGEBRAROOT giving
    the location of the directory above
  - The variable ALDORROOT giving the location of the aldor compiler
  - Optionally, the variable LIBALDORROT giving the location of the 
    libaldor library. This library could also be located in $ALDORROOT/lib

o Targets for users
  - objects
    Builds the 3 `.a' archives.
  - runtest
    Runs the tests. 
    !!! DO NOT WORRY ABOUT `ERROR' message for the moment !!!

o Targets for developers
  - checksrc
    Checks that all scripts and directories are in the right place.
  - aofiles
    Builds the 3 `.al' archives (see `src/Makefile' for more details).
  - testfiles
    Extracts the test files from the sources in src/.
  - install
    Moves the archives somewhere (see the scripts).
    (this target should only be used for developement
     and is not needed for building the distribution).
  - uninstall 
    Reverse operation.
  - clean
    Resets the `algebra' set of files (i.e. removes test files and archives).


USING libalgebra:
-----------------
The most convenient way is to copy or link the various lib/libalgebra* files
into the lib/ directory of aldor, as well as the include/*.as files into
the include/ directory of aldor.
If you choose not to do that, then you must add ALGEBRAROOT/lib and
ALGEBRAROOT/include to your LIBPATH and INCPATH environment variables
respectively, where ALGEBRAROOT stands for the libalgebra root path.
Please see the libalgebra user guide in the doc/ directory for more
information on using libalgebra.

Please report any problem/bugs to sumit@sophia.inria.fr
Notifying that address of a successful installation will put you on
a notification list for futures versions of libalgebra.
