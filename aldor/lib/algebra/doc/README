The Algebra reference manual algebra.pdf is meant to viewed online
with acrobat reader, which you can download from
         http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html

It is available in additional formats (dvi, html, postcript) from
         http://www-sop.inria.fr/cafe/Manuel.Bronstein/algebra/

In particular, if you need a hardcopy, we recommend that you print
the postcript version using a 2-sided printer. That version has
been formatted to fit 4 references pages on each sheet of paper.
